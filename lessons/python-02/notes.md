# LESSON 02 - Building Programs With Python

These notes are a guide to the speaker, as they present the material.

----
**SLIDE** Building Programs With Python (1)

----
**SLIDE** INTRODUCTION

----
**SLIDE** GOAL 1

* We are teaching programming, not `Python` *per se*
* We need to use *some* language, though
* Python is free, and likely to be usable on your machine
* Python is widely-used, and there's lots of support online
* It can be easier for novices to pick up than other languages
* You should use what is common in your area/with your colleagues
* The principles of programming are the same in other languages

----
**SLIDE** GOAL 2

* We're using a motivating example of data analysis
* Data is in plain text, tabular (CSV)
* Data represents patients and daily measurements
* We're going to analyse the data
* We're going to visualise the data
* We're going to get the computer to do this for us
* Automation is key: fewer human mistakes, easier to apply to other datasets, and share with others (transparency)

----
**SLIDE** SETUP

----
**SLIDE** SETTING UP **DEMO**

* We want a neat (clean) working environment
* **IF NECESSARY!**
* Change directory to desktop (in terminal or Explorer)
* Change your working directory to `python-novice-inflammation` (from yesterday/earlier)

----
**SLIDE** GETTING STARTED

----
**SLIDE** STARTING `JUPYTER` **DEMO**

* Start `Jupyter` from the command-line

----
**SLIDE** `JUPYTER` LANDING PAGE **DEMO**

* Landing page is a file browser, like Explorer/Finder
* Point out `Python` (`.py`) files, `.zip` files, and directories)
* Point out directory (`data`), and how the file symbols are different.
* Point out `New` button.

----
**SLIDE** CREATE A NEW NOTEBOOK **DEMO**

----
**SLIDE** MOTIVATION

* We wrote some code that plots values of interest from multiple datasets, but that code is long and complicated
* The code is also not very flexible if we want to deal with thousands of files, and we can't modify it to plot only a subset of files very easily
* Cutting and pasting is slow and error-prone
* **SO** we need to package our code for reuse.
* **We do this by writing functions**

----
**SLIDE** FUNCTIONS

----
**SLIDE** WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

* Functions in code work like mathematical functions, like `y=f(x)`
* `f()`  is the function
* `x`  is an input (or inputs)
* `y`  is the returned value, or output(s)
* The function's output  `y`  depends in some way on the value of  `x`  - defined by  `f()`.
* **Not all functions in code take an input, or produce a usable output, but the principle is generally the same.**

----
**SLIDE** MY FIRST FUNCTION

* We'll write a function to convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin, called `fahr_to_kelvin()`
* The mathematical function is described:
  * This function takes `x`, subtracts 32, multiplies by 5/9, and adds 273.15
* In `Python` this translates to the code below
  * Functions are *defined* by the `def` keyword
  * The name of the function follows the `def` keyword (equivalent to `f` in the mathematical example)
  * The *parameters* or *inputs* to the function are then defined in parentheses. These get a variable name **which only exists within the function**. Here, there is one parameter, called `temp`.
  * The function performs a calculation, which is *returned* by the `return` statement.
  * The value of `temp` is taken through the same calculation as in the mathematical function, and is then *return*ed.
* **Demo code**

----
**SLIDE** Calling the function

* We call `fahr_to_kelvin` in exactly the same way we call any other function we've seen so far

```python
print('freezing point of water:', fahr_to_kelvin(32))
print('boiling point of water:', fahr_to_kelvin(212))
```

----
**SLIDE** Composing functions

* Composing `Python` functions works just like mathematical functions: `y = f(g(x))`
* Suppose we have a function that converts Kelvin to Celsius, called `kelvin_to_celsius()`
* **Demo code**

```python
def kelvin_to_celsius(temp_k):
    return temp_k - 273.15
print('absolute zero in Celsius:', kelvin_to_celsius(0.0))
```

* We could convert a temperature in fahrenheit (`temp_f`) to a temperature in celsius (`temp_c`) by executing the code:

```python
temp_f = 212.0
temp_c = kelvin_to_celsius(fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f))
print(temp_c)
```

----
**SLIDE** NEW FUNCTIONS FROM OLD

* We can wrap this composed function inside a new function: `fahr_to_celsius`:
* **Demo code**

```python
def fahr_to_celsius(temp_f):
    return kelvin_to_celsius(fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f))
print('freezing point of water in Celsius:', fahr_to_celsius(32.0))
```

* **This is how programs are built: combining small bits into larger bits until the function we want is obtained**

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 01

```python
def outer(s)
    return s[0] + s[-1]
```

----
**SLIDE** SCOPE

* Variables defined within a function, including parameters, are not 'visible' outside the function
* This is called *function scope*
**Demo code**

```python
a = "Hello"

def my_fn(a):
  a = "Goodbye"
  
my_fn(a)  
print(a)
```

* To move values to and from functions, you should generally `return` them from the function
* **Demo code**

```python
a = "Hello"

def my_fn(a):
  a = "Goodbye"
  
a = my_fn(a)
print(a)
```

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 02

* Solution: `1: 7 3` (this differs from that on the SWC page)

----
**SLIDE** ANALYSIS

----
**SLIDE** TIDYING UP

* Now we can write functions
* Let's make the inflammation analysis easier to reuse
* **Do the imports!**

```python
%pylab inline

import matplotlib.pyplot
import numpy as np
import os
import seaborn
```

----
**SLIDE** `ANALYSE()`

* We'll write a function called `analyse()` that plots the data
* **Demo code**

```python
def analyze(data):
    fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

    axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
    axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
    axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)

    axes1.set_ylabel('average')
    axes1.plot(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))

    axes2.set_ylabel('max')
    axes2.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))

    axes3.set_ylabel('min')
    axes3.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))

    fig.tight_layout()
    matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

----
**SLIDE** `DETECT_PROBLEMS()`

* We noticed before that some data was questionable
* This function spots problems with the data:
  * The first datapoint is 0, and the 20th is 20
  * The sum of all minima is zero
* **Demo code**

```python
def detect_problems(data):
    if numpy.max(data, axis=0)[0] == 0 and numpy.max(data, axis=0)[20] == 20:
        print('Suspicious looking maxima!')
    elif numpy.sum(numpy.min(data, axis=0)) == 0:
        print('Minima add up to zero!')
    else:
        print('Seems OK!')
```

----
**SLIDE** CODE REUSE

* Now we can identify the input files, then apply one function per action in a loop:
  * Load the data with `np.loadtxt()`
  * Print the filename
  * `analyse()` the data
  * `detect_problems()` in the data
* **Demo code**

```python
filenames = [os.path.join('data', f) for f in os.listdir('data')
             if f.startswith('inflammation')]
for fname in filenames:
    data = np.loadtxt(fname, delimiter=",")
    print(fname)
    analyse(data)
    detect_problems(data)       
```

* **The code is much shorter (as we read it, here)**
* **The function names are human-readable and descriptive**
* **It is much easier to see what the code is doing**

----
**SLIDE** TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION

----
**SLIDE** MOTIVATION

* Once a useful function is written, it gets reused over and over, often without further checking
* When you write a function you should:
  * Test output for correctness
  * Document the expected function
* We'll demonstrate this with a function to centre a numerical array
* **Demo code**

```python
def centre(data, desired):
    return (data - np.mean(data)) + desired
```

----
**SLIDE** TEST DATASETS

* We could try `centre()` on our real data, but we *don't know what the answer should be!**
* We'll use `numpy`'s `zeros()` function to generate an input set where we know the answer
* **Demo code**

```python
z = np.zeros((2, 2))
print(centre(z, 3.0))
```

* If this works, we'll try it on real data


----
**SLIDE** REAL DATA

* **Demo code**

```python
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
print(centre(data, 0))
```

* This looks OK, but how would we know it worked?

----
**SLIDE** CHECK PROPERTIES

* We can check properties of the original and centred data
  * `mean`, `min`, `max`, `std`
* We'd expect the mean of the new dataset to be approximately `0.0`
* The variance of the dataset should be unchanged.
* Also, the range (`max` - `min`) should be unchanged.
* **Demo code**

```python
centred = centre(data, 0)
print('original min, mean, and max are:', np.min(data), np.mean(data), np.max(data))
print('min, mean, and max of centered data are:', np.min(centred),
      np.mean(centred), np.max(centred))
print('std dev before and after:', np.std(data), np.std(centred))      
```

* The range and variance are as expected, but the mean is not quite `0.0`
* The function is probably OK, as-is

----
**SLIDE** DOCUMENTING FUNCTIONS

* We can document what our function does by writing comments in the code, and this is a good thing.
* But Python allows us to document what a function does directly in the function using a *docstring*.
* This is a string that is put in a specific place in the function definition, and it has special properties that are useful.
* To add a docstring to our centre() function, we add a string immediately after the function declaration
* **Demo code**

```python
def centre(data, desired):
    """Returns the array in data, recentered around the desired value."""
    return (data - numpy.mean(data)) + desired
```

* This documents the function directly in the source code, and it also hooks that documentation into `Python`'s `help` system.
* We can ask for help on any function using the `help()` function:

```python
help(centre)
```

* Using the triple quotes (""") allows us to use a multi-line string to describe the function:

```python
def centre(data, desired):
    """Returns the array in data, recentered around the desired value.
    
    Example: centre([1, 2, 3], 0) => [-1, 0, 1]
    """
    return (data - np.mean(data)) + desired
```

----
**SLIDE** DEFAULT ARGUMENTS

* So far we have named the two arguments in our `centre()` function
* We need to specify both of them when we call the function
* **Demo code**

```python
centre([1, 2, 3], 0)
```

* We can set a *default* value for function arguments when we define the function, by assigning a value in the function declaration, as follows:

```python
def centre(data, desired=0.0):
    """Returns the array in data, recentered around the desired value.
    
    Example: centre([1, 2, 3], 0) => [-1, 0, 1]
    """
    return (data - np.mean(data)) + desired
```

* The change we've made is to set `desired=0.0` in the function *prototype*.
* Now, by default, the function will recentre the passed data to zero, without us having to specify that:

```python
centre([1, 2, 3])
```

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 03

```python
def rescale(data):
    """Returns input array rescaled to [0.0, 0.1]."""
    l = np.min(data)
    h = np.max(data)
    return (data - L) / (H - L)
```

----
**SLIDE** ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS

----
**SLIDE** CREATE A NEW NOTEBOOK

----
**SLIDE** ERRORS

* Programming is essentially just making errors over and over again until the code works ;)
* The key skill is learning how to identify, and then fix, the errors when they are reported.
* **All programmers** make errors. 

----
**SLIDE** TRACEBACK

* `Python` tries to be helpful, and provides extensive information about errors
* These are called *tracebacks*
* We'll induce one, so we can look at it
* **Demo code**

```python
def favourite_ice_cream():
    ice_creams = [
        "chocolate",
        "vanilla",
        "strawberry"
    ]
    print(ice_creams[3])

favourite_ice_cream()
```

----
**SLIDE** PARTS OF A TRACEBACK

* **Talk through the traceback on the notebook**
* The *stack* of all steps leading to the error is shown
* The steps are separated by lines starting `<ipython-input-1…`
* The steps run in order from top to bottom
* The first step has an arrow, showing where we were when the error happened. We were calling the `favourite_ice_cream()` function
* The second step tells us that we were *in* the `favourite_ice_cream()` function
* The second step also points to the line `print(ice_creams[3])`, which is where the error occurs
* The second step is the last step, and the precise error is shown on the final line: `IndexError: list index out of range`
* Together, this tells us that we have made an index error in the line `print(ice_creams[3])`, and by looking we can see that we've tried to use an index outside the length of the list.
