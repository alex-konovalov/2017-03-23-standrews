# LESSON 02 - Building Programs With Python

These notes are a guide to the speaker, as they present the material.

----
**SLIDE** Building Programs With Python (1)

----
**SLIDE** INTRODUCTION

----
**SLIDE** GOAL 1

* We are teaching programming, not `Python` *per se*
* We need to use *some* language, though
* Python is free, and likely to be usable on your machine
* Python is widely-used, and there's lots of support online
* It can be easier for novices to pick up than other languages
* You should use what is common in your area/with your colleagues
* The principles of programming are the same in other languages

----
**SLIDE** GOAL 2

* We're using a motivating example of data analysis
* Data is in plain text, tabular (CSV)
* Data represents patients and daily measurements
* We're going to analyse the data
* We're going to visualise the data
* We're going to get the computer to do this for us
* Automation is key: fewer human mistakes, easier to apply to other datasets, and share with others (transparency)

----
**SLIDE** SETUP

----
**SLIDE** SETTING UP **DEMO**

* We want a neat (clean) working environment
* **IF NECESSARY!**
* Change directory to desktop (in terminal or Explorer)
* Change your working directory to `python-novice-inflammation` (from yesterday/earlier)

----
**SLIDE** GETTING STARTED

----
**SLIDE** STARTING `JUPYTER` **DEMO**

* Start `Jupyter` from the command-line

----
**SLIDE** `JUPYTER` LANDING PAGE **DEMO**

* Landing page is a file browser, like Explorer/Finder
* Point out `Python` (`.py`) files, `.zip` files, and directories)
* Point out directory (`data`), and how the file symbols are different.
* Point out `New` button.

**SLIDE** CREATE A NEW NOTEBOOK **DEMO**
